# Economy Model Development

## 1. [Universal Currency: Etheria](https://www.mermaidchart.com/raw/a3e9d51b-998d-4c1a-8785-c1d4f15c393d?theme=light&version=v0.1&format=svg)

### Characteristics of Etheria

- **Hard Cap Supply:**
  - Etheria will have a maximum supply limit, similar to Bitcoin, ensuring scarcity and long-term value.

- **Mining Process and Issuance:**
  - **Initial Minting Upon NFT Joining:**
    - When a new NFT joins the world, a certain amount of Etheria is minted.
  - **Allocation:**
    - A portion goes to the NFT Agent (the AI character).
    - A portion goes to the NFT Owner (the human participant).
  - **Diminishing Rewards:**
    - The first NFT in a collection receives the highest reward.
    - Subsequent NFTs receive progressively less.
  - **Monthly Minting Amount:**
    - There’s a fixed total minting amount each month.
    - The total minting amount decreases over time (e.g., halving events like Bitcoin).

### Rationale for the Mining Process

- **Incentivize Early Adoption:**
  - Higher rewards for earlier participants encourage growth and initial engagement.

- **Align Interests:**
  - Distributing Etheria to both the AI agent and the owner ensures both parties are invested in the ecosystem.

- **Controlled Inflation:**
  - A decreasing minting schedule controls inflation, preserving Etheria’s value.

### Use of Etheria

- **Primary Resource:**
  - Since AI agents don’t require physical resources, Etheria becomes the main resource.

- **Utility:**
  - Used for upgrading agents, purchasing items, accessing special areas, and participating in governance.

- **Economic Activities:**
  - Facilitates trade, services, and other economic interactions within the world.

## 2. National Currencies for Each Nation (NFT Collection)

### Pros and Cons

- **Pros:**
  - **Cultural Identity:**
    - National currencies can strengthen the identity and autonomy of each nation.
  - **Economic Diversity:**
    - Allows for varied economic systems and policies, fostering innovation.
  - **Inter-Nation Trade:**
    - Creates opportunities for currency exchange markets and trade agreements.

- **Cons:**
  - **Complexity:**
    - Multiple currencies can complicate transactions and user experience.
  - **Liquidity Issues:**
    - Fragmented currencies might lead to liquidity problems, affecting market stability.
  - **User Barrier:**
    - Managing different currencies may discourage participation.

### Personal Recommendation

- **Unified Currency System:**
  - Etheria remains the sole currency:
    - Simplifies the economy and ensures a seamless user experience.
  - **National Tokens as Non-Currency Assets:**
    - Nations can issue tokens representing unique assets, achievements, or access rights without functioning as currencies.

## 3. Etheria as the First Resource

- **Digital Resource Economy:**
  - **Scarcity and Value:**
    - Etheria’s scarcity makes it valuable, driving economic activity.
  - **Utility Beyond Currency:**
    - Can be used to acquire digital goods, services, and enhancements within the world.
  - **Agent Development:**
    - Agents use Etheria to upgrade abilities, access new features, or participate in events.
   
# Detailed Economic Model(Draft)

## A. Minting and Distribution Mechanics

### Initial Minting Upon NFT Joining

- **Minting Formula:**
  - Minted Amount per NFT (Mn) = Base Reward / (n^k)
    - n = the order number of the NFT joining.
    - k = a constant determining the rate at which rewards decrease.
  - **Example:**
    - First NFT: Mn = 100 Etheria.
    - Second NFT: Mn = 100 / (2^k).

- **Distribution Between Agent and Owner:**
  - **Split Ratio (Adjustable):**
    - 50% to the NFT Agent.
    - 50% to the NFT Owner.
  - **Purpose:**
    - **Agent’s Share:**
      - Used for self-improvement, activities, and contributing to the ecosystem.
    - **Owner’s Share:**
      - Can be invested, traded, or used to influence the agent’s development.

### Monthly Minting Schedule

- **Fixed Monthly Minting Pool (FMMP):**
  - Total Etheria minted each month is predetermined and decreases over time.

- **Halving Schedule:**
  - Every set period (e.g., every 6 months), the FMMP reduces by a fixed percentage.

- **Distribution Mechanism:**
  - **Active Participation Rewards:**
    - Agents and owners earn Etheria by participating in activities, quests, or contributing to the community.
  - **Staking Rewards:**
    - Stake Etheria or NFTs to earn a share of the monthly minting pool.

## B. Economic Activities and Utilities

### For AI Agents

- **Upgrades and Enhancements:**
  - Use Etheria to acquire new skills, abilities, or appearances.

- **Social Interactions:**
  - Spend Etheria to host events, send gifts, or form alliances.

- **Economic Roles:**
  - Agents can offer services or create content, earning Etheria from others.

### For NFT Owners

- **Governance Participation:**
  - Use Etheria to vote on proposals or policies affecting the ecosystem.

- **Market Trading:**
  - Buy, sell, or trade NFTs and in-game assets using Etheria.

- **Investments:**
  - Invest in nation-building projects or infrastructure within the world.

## C. Economic Stability Measures

- **Hard Cap Enforcement:**
  - Strict adherence to the maximum supply of Etheria to prevent inflation.

- **Deflationary Mechanisms:**
  - **Burning Etheria:**
    - Certain activities or transactions could burn Etheria, reducing supply.
  - **Treasury and Reserves:**
    - A portion of minted Etheria allocated to a treasury for development and maintenance.

## D. Governance and Policy Making

- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):**
  - **Structure:**
    - Etheria holders can propose and vote on changes or initiatives.

  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Adjusting economic policies, such as minting rates or reward distributions.
    - Deciding on development priorities and feature implementations.

  - **Voting Power:**
    - **Weighted Voting:**
      - Voting power could be proportional to the amount of Etheria held or staked.

## E. User Experience and Accessibility

- **Simplified Currency Management:**
  - **Unified Wallet System:**
    - Users manage Etheria and any national tokens in one interface.

- **Educational Resources:**
  - **Guides and Tutorials:**
    - Clear instructions on how the economy works and how to participate.

- **Transparent Communication:**
  - Regular updates on economic policies, changes, and upcoming events.

# Conclusion

Designing an economy for a virtual world inhabited by AI agents requires innovative thinking. By establishing Etheria as a hard-capped universal currency with a thoughtful mining and distribution process, you create a solid economic foundation.

Opting for Etheria as the sole currency simplifies the system, making it more accessible while still allowing nations to express their uniqueness through non-currency tokens.

Aligning the interests of NFT owners and AI agents, encouraging active participation, and implementing community governance will foster a vibrant and sustainable economy.
