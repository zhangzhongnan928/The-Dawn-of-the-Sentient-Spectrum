# Why "The Major"

## Origin & Inspiration

The name "The Major" comes from Major Motoko Kusanagi, the protagonist of "Ghost in the Shell" - a seminal work that explores the intersection of human consciousness and artificial intelligence. This choice perfectly mirrors our platform's core concept: the fusion of NFT identity (Ghost/Soul) with AI capability (Shell/Body).

## Core Concepts Alignment

  - Unique personality traits
  - Individual values
  - Persistent digital identity
  
- **Shell** = AI Body (Capability)
  - Operational abilities
  - Learning and growth
  - Service execution

Just as Major Kusanagi maintains her identity (ghost) while operating in a synthetic body (shell), our platform enables NFTs to serve as authentic identities (ghosts) for AI Agents (shells).
