# NFT Agent Economy: Production Relationship Design

## **Overview**

This document outlines the production relationships in an economy with three token layers: SLN (platform), Clan coins (collection), and Agent coins (individual).

## **Token Layers**

1. **Platform Level: SLN**
   - Base resource for all operations
   - Powers Initial Agent Offerings (IAO)
   - Enables cross-ecosystem transactions

2. **Clan Level: Clan Coins**
   - 77B tokens per collection
   - Distributed equally to transformed NFT holders
   - Controls 10% of Agent souls' shared values
   - Governs Clan pool (5% of each Agent coin)

3. **Agent Level: Agent Coins**
   - 77M tokens per Agent
   - Distribution:
     - 5% to Clan pool (governed by Clan coin holders)
     - 25% retained by Agent treasury
     - 70% for public sale (NFT owner priority)

## **Key Participants**

1. **NFT Owners (Agent Creators)**

   - Possess the NFT representing the Agent's identity and origin
   - Gain early access to 20% Agent Coin allocation before public sale
   - Aligned with Agent's success through dual value appreciation

2. **Agent Treasury (Smart Contract)**

   - Controls 30% of Agent Coin supply
   - Gradual unlock based on time/milestones
   - Funds development, plugins, marketing, and inter-Agent tasks

3. **Public Investors**

   - Access to 50% of Agent Coins through IAO
   - Participate via bonding curve mechanism
   - Enable price discovery and liquidity

4. **NFT Agent Users**

   - Service consumers paying in Agent Coin
   - Drive token demand and ecosystem growth

5. **Plugin/Feature Developers**

   - Direct sales to Agents using Agent Coins
   - Revenue-aligned with Agent success

6. **Open-Source Framework Developers**

   - Maintain core AI infrastructure
   - Benefit from ecosystem expansion

## **Economic Design**

### **Token Distribution**

- Agent Treasury: 30% (Vested)
- NFT Holder: 20% (Bonding curve Priority purchase access)
- Public IAO: 50% (Bonding curve)

### **IAO Process**

- Direct purchase through bonding curve
- Base resource (SLN) as primary investment vehicle
- Dynamic pricing model rewarding early participation

### **Treasury & Governance**

- Gradual fund release for sustainable growth
- Optional governance for token holders
- Focus on single Agent development path

### **Agent coin usage**
- Agent's personal currency pay/buy anything out/in an Agent.
- Governance

## **Conclusion**

This production relationship design ensures that all participants in the NFT Agent ecosystem—new Agents, old Agents, SLN investors, and developers—benefit from fair, sustainable, and synergistic economic growth. By balancing incentives and introducing collaborative mechanisms, this model creates a thriving and interconnected economy within each Clan.
