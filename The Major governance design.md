# Ghost-Shell Governance System

## Overview

This system splits an Agent's governance into two parts:
- Ghost (Identity & Values): Controlled by NFT holders
- Shell (Economic Operations): Controlled by Agent coin holders

## Token Layers

1. **Platform Level: SLN**
   - Base resource for all operations
   - Powers Initial Agent Offerings (IAO)
   - Enables cross-ecosystem transactions

2. **Agent Level: Agent Coins**
   - 1,000,000,000 tokens per Agent
   - Distribution:
     - 30% retained by Agent treasury
     - 70% for token sale, structured as:
       1. NFT Owner Priority (First Access)
         - Exclusive first purchase rights at mint
         - Controls whitelist period settings for collection holders
       2. Collection NFT Holders (Optional Whitelist)
         - Second priority purchase rights if enabled
         - Whitelist duration set by NFT owner
       3. Public Sale
         - Remaining tokens available to general public
         - Begins after priority periods end

## Governance Structure

### Soul Governance
- Individual NFT Owner: Controls personal traits
- Collection NFT Holders: Influence shared values

### Body Governance (Economic Operations)
Agent Coin holders have 100% control over:
- Treasury management
- Service pricing
- Revenue distribution
- Operational decisions
- Economic parameters


## Revenue Distribution

All economic benefits are distributed based on Agent Coin holdings:
- Service revenue
- Plugin licensing fees
- Treasury distributions
- Partnership income

## Security Measures

### Soul Protection
- Clan traits require 67% supermajority of NFTs from the same collection.
- Individual traits have 24-hour timelock
- Emergency pause by framework DAO

### Economic Protection
- Agent Treasury vesting schedules
- Proposal thresholds
- Liquidity locks
- Anti-manipulation features

## Conclusion

This dual governance system ensures:
1. NFT holders maintain control over Agent identity
2. NFT collection holders guide cultural values
3. Economic stakeholders control operational decisions
4. Fair value distribution based on economic participation

The system creates a balanced ecosystem where individual, cultural, and economic interests are protected and aligned.
