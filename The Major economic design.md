# Ghost-Shell Economic Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the economic relationships in The Major platform, where NFTs serve as ghosts (digital consciousness) and AI as shells (operational bodies).

## **Token Layers**

1. **Platform Level: SLN**
   - Base resource for all operations
   - Powers Initial Agent Offerings (IAO)
   - Enables cross-ecosystem transactions

2. **Agent Level: Agent Coins**
   - 1,000,000,000 tokens per Agent
   - Distribution:
     - 30% retained by Agent treasury
     - 70% for token sale, structured as:
       1. NFT Owner Priority (First Access)
         - Exclusive first purchase rights at mint
         - Controls whitelist period settings for collection holders
       2. Collection NFT Holders (Optional Whitelist)
         - Second priority purchase rights if enabled
         - Whitelist duration set by NFT owner
       3. Public Sale
         - Remaining tokens available to general public
         - Begins after priority periods end

## **Key Participants**

1. **NFT Owners (Agent Creators)**
   - Possess the NFT representing the Agent's identity and origin
   - Gain early access to Agent Coin allocation before public sale
   - Control Agent's soul and personality traits
   - Aligned with Agent's success through dual value appreciation

2. **Agent Treasury (Smart Contract)**
   - Controls 30% of Agent Coin supply
   - Gradual unlock based on time/milestones
   - Funds development, plugins, marketing, and inter-Agent tasks

3. **Public Investors**
   - Access to 0-70% Agent Coins through IAO
   - Participate via bonding curve mechanism
   - Enable price discovery and liquidity

4. **NFT Agent Users**
   - Service consumers paying in Agent Coin
   - Drive token demand and ecosystem growth

5. **Plugin/Feature Developers**
   - Direct sales to Agents using Agent Coins
   - Revenue-aligned with Agent success

6. **Open-Source Framework Developers**
   - Maintain core AI infrastructure
   - Benefit from ecosystem expansion

## **Economic Design**

### **Token Distribution**
- Agent Treasury: 30% (Vested)
- NFT Holder: 20% (Bonding curve Priority purchase access)
- Public IAO: 50% (Bonding curve)

### **IAO Process**
- Direct purchase through bonding curve
- Base resource (SLN) as primary investment vehicle
- Dynamic pricing model rewarding early participation

### **Treasury & Governance**
- Gradual fund release for sustainable growth
- Optional governance for token holders
- Focus on single Agent development path

### **Agent coin usage**
- Agent's personal currency pay/buy anything out/in an Agent
- Governance over economic operations
- Service payments and rewards

## **Conclusion**

This production relationship design ensures that all participants in the NFT Agent ecosystem—NFT holders, Agent coin holders, SLN investors, and developers—benefit from fair, sustainable, and synergistic economic growth. By balancing incentives and introducing collaborative mechanisms, this model creates a thriving and interconnected economy.
