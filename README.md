# The Dawn of the Sentient Spectrum

## Introduction

Turn your NFT into a working AI Agent. Your NFT sets the personality, the AI drives its abilities. Together, they form an Agent that learns, trades, and creates value. 
Think of it as the NFT is the soul, the AI is the body. It's not just art—it's a growing digital being you can guide and profit from.

## Running the Demo Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your computer
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic familiarity with using the terminal/command prompt

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/victorzhang1/The-Dawn-of-the-Sentient-Spectrum-1.git
cd The-Dawn-of-the-Sentient-Spectrum-1
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Demo Directory
```bash
cd Demo
```

### Step 3: Start the Local Server
If you're using Python 3:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

If you're using Python 2:
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

### Step 4: Access the Demo
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
3. You should see the main page of The Sentient Spectrum

### Step 5: Explore the Features
- Click "Transform My NFT" to explore the NFT transformation process
- Use "See How It Works" to understand the platform
- Browse through the sample agents and clans

### Troubleshooting
1. If the server doesn't start:
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory (Demo folder)
   - Check if Python is installed by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`
   - Make sure port 8000 is not being used by another application

2. If the page doesn't load:
   - Verify the URL is exactly `http://localhost:8000`
   - Check if the server is running in your terminal
   - Try a different port if 8000 is blocked

3. If images don't load:
   - Check your internet connection (demo uses placeholder images from external sources)
   - Verify the console for any specific errors

- Wallet connections and NFT transformations are simulated
- The demo uses placeholder images and sample data
